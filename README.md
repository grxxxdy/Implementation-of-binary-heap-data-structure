# Task (translated using ChatGPT):

1. Create a Data structure to store objects with characteristics according to the chosen task:  
1.1 Choose a specific criterion to determine the more prioritized object based on all its characteristics.  
1.2 Overload the "less than" operator (operator<).  
1.3 Overload the "equals" operator (operator==).  
2. Implement a non-decreasing (max-heap) binary heap:  
2.1 Create a BinaryHeap structure, representing a binary tree for the binary heap operation. Use a custom created dynamic array.  
2.2 Implement basic methods for traversing the binary tree.  
2.3 Implement internal methods for heap organization.
3. Implement a priority queue based on the binary heap.  
3.1 Create a PriorityQueue structure that will contain a BinaryHeap.  
3.2 Implement basic methods for priority queue operation.
4. Perform testing using the provided testPriorityQueue() function.  
4.1 Check the correctness and speed of operation, comparing it with the ready-made STL priority_queue library solution.
5. Implement heap sort based on the binary heap.  
5.1 Create a HeapSort structure based on the binary heap that works with the int data type. Implement the necessary methods.  
5.2 Compare it with the ready-made STL std::sort() library solution or other sorting algorithms implemented in previous works. Conduct testing with time measurements on different input data (different lengths of arrays, best/average/worst cases for sorting).
